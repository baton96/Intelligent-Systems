# Context
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two projects were created for the course of "Intelligent Systems" on the International Hellenic University in Thessaloniki during my Erasmus stay in the spring/summer semester 2019. One of the project is related to the [evolutionary algorithms](evolution) and the second one to the [fuzzy logic](fuzzy). More in-depth descriptions can be found in the subdirectories.
